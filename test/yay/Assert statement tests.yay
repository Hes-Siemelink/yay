Test case: Assert equals with nested objects

Assert equals:
  actual:
    something:
      id: 123
      path: /home
      token: !any
  expected:
    something:
      id: !any
      path: /home
      token: 456


---
Test case: Use assert with simple 'if' syntax

Assert that:
  object: one
  equals: one


---
Test case: Use assert with complicated 'if' syntax

Assert that:
  all:
  - any:
    - object: one
      equals: two
    - object: one
      equals: one
  - object: three
    equals: three
